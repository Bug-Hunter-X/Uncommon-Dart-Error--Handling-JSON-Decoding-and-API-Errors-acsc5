# Uncommon Dart Error: Handling JSON Decoding and API Errors

This repository demonstrates a common scenario in Dart programming: fetching data from an API and handling potential errors during JSON decoding and API calls.  While this specific example doesn't highlight an *uncommon* error in itself, it serves as a foundation for understanding more complex error scenarios.

The `bug.dart` file shows a basic implementation with potential issues:

* **Lack of specific error handling:** While a `try-catch` block is used, there isn't detailed handling for specific HTTP error codes or JSON parsing exceptions. 
* **Rethrowing exceptions:** The example rethrows the exception after catching it, which is useful for higher-level error handling but might require modification based on application design.

The `bugSolution.dart` file provides a more robust approach with better error handling, improved exception handling, and more specific error messages.

This example is useful for understanding how to correctly handle async operations, API responses, and JSON parsing in a robust way to prevent unexpected crashes and improve the overall reliability of the application.
